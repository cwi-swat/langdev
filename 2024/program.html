              <p>
                One of the main challenges of model-based systems engineering
                (MBSE) is to provide adequate levels of abstraction and
                notations for different stakeholders and domains, while ensuring
                consistency and traceability across the system lifecycle.
                Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are a promising technology to
                address this challenge, as they allow the definition of tailored
                syntax and semantics for specific system aspects, such as
                requirements, architecture, behaviour or verification. DSLs can
                also facilitate the integration of MBSE with other engineering
                disciplines, such as software, hardware or cyber-physical
                systems, by enabling the interoperability and transformation of
                models across different domains. Furthermore, DSLs can leverage
                the benefits of MBSE, such as increased productivity, quality
                and reuse, by providing automated visualisation and analysis,
                simulation and code generation capabilities for domain-specific
                models. Therefore, DSLs and MBSE can mutually enhance each other
                and contribute to the adoption of model-based approaches in
                mainstream development. Both DSLs and MBSE have been around for
                a quite a while and despite their promise, we still see many
                obstacles in their adoption in practice. In my talk, I will
                reflect on our past experiences, the current challenges in the
                European space context, and look ahead at the near future for
                opportunities to collaborate.

              <p>
                Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has significantly
                impacted the space industry, being the European Space Agency
                (ESA) a key actor of the adoption of these technologies. MBSE is
                a practice digitalising systems engineering, and the goal is to
                apply it in all phases of a project, ranging from Phase 0 /
                pre-Phase A (concept development) to Phase F (closeout). The
                transitioning from a traditional approach to MBSE presents
                several challenges, specially for big corporations trying to
                change their well-established procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                GMV's practical case is studied in this presentation, looking
                back at the goals set when MBSE was initially incorporated,
                where the company is at the current time, and what are the
                future prospects. A timeline outlining key activities performed
                in the past and next steps in the near future is provided.
                Moreover, an overview of current projects where MBSE is at the
                centre is presented, engaging discussion on the challenges
                specific to the application of MBSE in space projects involving
                large teams. Topics including requirements management, document
                generation automation and reusability between projects are put
                on the spotlight of the discussion.

              <p>
                The development of on-board satellite software faces numerous
                challenges and demanding deadlines due to the complexity and
                critical nature of space missions. Validation and verification
                (V&amp;V) are crucial to the development process, as they
                provide evidence for non-functional requirements and ensure
                compliance with quality standards such as the European Space
                Agency's ECSS-E-40. Another major challenge is the use of
                various configured deployment platforms and the need for
                adaptation to hardware evolutions during the engineering
                process.

              <p>
                The Space Research Group of the University of Alcalá has
                successfully participated in multiple space missions, such as
                the development of the on-board software for the instrument
                control unit of the Energetic Particle Detector of Solar Orbiter
                and the INTA's Nanosat missions. To carry out these activities,
                we have used an approach that incorporates solutions based on
                domain-specific languages and component-based software
                engineering, which have significantly streamlined the
                development process, enhancing efficiency and ensuring that our
                developments are compliant with established standards.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this presentation, we will share case studies of our
                model-based approach, which include the integration of tools for
                the verification of temporal constraints and configuration
                management, automatic code generation, and the integration of
                low-code tools for validation tests.

                Identifying the best abstractions to integrate into a
                Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is typically a continuous and
                iterative process. In practice, it is often the result of usage
                of a more generic DSL and the identification over time of
                recurring patterns to be abstracted and integrated in a more
                specific DSL. While collaboration between domain experts and
                language engineers is essential to initiate the development of a
                DSL and its associated tools, in many contexts it is impractical
                to keep the language engineers continuously involved for ongoing
                iterations. Therefore, it becomes crucial for domain experts to
                be able to independently and incrementally refine their DSL and
                its tooling. However, current Software Language Engineering
                (SLE) tools and methods (e.g., language workbenches) demand
                extensive expertise in language engineering, which domain
                experts often lack.

                In this talk, we present a novel approach enabling domain
                experts to iteratively specialise their own DSLs and associated
                tooling. Our approach integrates several techniques, including
                language slicing for immediate and opportunistic reuse, as well
                as the promotion of language constructs into the metalanguage to
                facilitate the definition of new constructs. We demonstrate the
                relevance of our approach through a case study in the security
                domain, that we use to identify and to discuss the challenges
                associated with achieving this vision.

                We now present the advanced approach of live metamodeling, which

                Changes to the metamodel of a graphical DSL are immediately

                The availability of AI features to enhance developer

                environments cannot keep the pace and by default do not have

                expected to have available only few training examples, but also
                that the amount of time available to develop an AI assistant is

                a new open-source and free parser generator for Rust that
                supports deterministic LR (with various flavors of LALR) and

              </p>
              <p>
                Rustemo features a clean separation between its core components:
                lexers, parsers, and builders. Lexers break an input sequence
                into tokens. Parsers perform syntax analysis on the tokens
                recognized by the lexer, while builders are responsible for
                producing the final output. By selecting or writing an
                appropriate lexer, different inputs can be parsed. Additionally,
                by choosing or writing an appropriate builder, one can obtain an
                auto-generated and manually tuned abstract syntax tree, a
                concrete syntax tree, or another structure at the end of the
                parsing process. For the default builder, AST types and actions
                are deduced from the grammar, allowing users to change them
                while preserving the modifications in subsequent round-trip
                generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although still a relatively young project, Rustemo implements a
                notable set of features[1], is fully
                <a href="https://www.igordejanovic.net/rustemo/">documented</a>,
                and has good test coverage.

                Type systems are crucial parts of developing languages. Among
                others, types systems are needed for checking static semantics
                like validating assignability, resolving cross-references to
                type-dependent targets like overloaded functions, and generating
                source code for statically typed languages like translating DSLs
                to TypeScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developing type systems for languages faces several recurring
                challenges, including similar kinds of types like primitives,
                classes, and functions, recursive type definitions, performance
                optimizations, and providing meaningful error messages for users
                of the language.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the rise of software running in the web including
                programming languages and DSLs, Typir is introduced as the new
                open-source framework for type checking in the web. Implemented
                in TypeScript, Typir supports textual languages developed in the
                web stack, and can be applied to other model sources as well.
                Typir is designed to be more pragmatic than formal, e.g. no rule
                engine is used, but provides solutions for recurring type
                checking challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                After motivating challenges when developing type systems from
                scratch, this talk shows the design of Typir and applies Typir
                to concrete example languages. This presentation aims to discuss
                with the language engineering community needs for web-based type
                checking, to collect early feedback and to identify additional

              <p>
                Mutation testing is a well-known technique for assessing the
                quality of software test suites. It involves introducing
                artificial faults into the source code, which generates a set of
                source variations called mutants. Next, we can apply the test
                suites to such mutants to account for how many of these mutants
                are detected, i.e., how many of them are killed. This measure
                yields a metric of the quality of the test suites called
                mutation score.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creating ad-hoc mutation testing tools from scratch is costly
                and error-prone, making difficult its application to
                Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). To alleviate such
                inconveniences, the Miso group built a domain-agnostic tool to
                engineer language-specific mutation testing tools called
                Wodel-Test. Using Wodel-Test, we have successfully generated
                mutation testing tools for both DSLs and general-purpose
                languages like finite automata, Java, ATL, and task-oriented
                chatbots.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this presentation, we will showcase Wodel-Test for chatbots.
                The latter are defined using a DSL called Conga, which can
                generate code for chatbot platforms like Dialogflow and Rasa. We
                will demonstrate all steps in developing the testing solution
                and its use in analysing chatbots and their test suites.

                Delivering AI applications that understand custom DSLs is a
                challenge. Even state-of-the-art models have trouble recognizing
                and generating syntax for novel DSLs. Good prompting, retrieval
                augmented generation, and fine-tuning can help to correct this,
                but it's a time-intensive task, and you may not get the results
                you want in the end. For Langium-based DSLs, we've had the same
                problem, and so we would like to present Langium-AI as a

                Langium-AI is a proposed extension to the Langium engineering
                framework to support developing AI applications for DSLs in
                parallel with your DSL itself. We'll demonstrate how this
                approach works by deeply integrating the design process with the
                existing Langium workflow, resulting in consistent & testable
                results throughout the development process. We'll also walk
                through a concrete example of such an AI application being
                developed for a fresh DSL.

                sequence-to-sequence tasks like language translation. A dataset
                is prepared by tokenizing ( the process of converting text into

                optimize model performance. The translation process was enhanced
                by integrating ANTLR4 for parsing PL/I code and using Jinja2 for
                code generation, ensuring a smooth transition from legacy to

                (OGC) has been developing open and interoperable standards for
                the global geospatial community since 1994, within the framework
                of Geographic Information Systems and the World Wide Web. These
                standards promote agreements among industry players to ensure
                the interoperability of geoprocessing systems and facilitate the
                exchange of geographic information for user benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new <a href="https://ogcapi.ogc.org/">OGC APIs</a> are
                transforming the sharing, accessing, integration, and analysis
                of geospatial/location information. These APIs are designed to
                simplify the provision and use of geospatial data on the web,
                integrating it with other information seamlessly. They build on
                the legacy OGC web services standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS,
                etc.), defining resource-centric APIs that utilize modern web
                development practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                These standards act as "building blocks" for creating novel APIs
                for web access to geospatial content. One major challenge in
                publishing geospatial data is the lack of connection to
                underlying data models, making the data potentially useless or
                inapplicable for intended purposes. This can hinder developers
                and data scientists, leading to effort duplication and
                low-quality data. The OGC aims to create standards for
                geospatial data models by providing a way in which models can be
                documented.

                provide an effective solution by defining documentation and data
                models within the service, creating more FAIR (Findable,
                Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) publications. The adoption
                of these building blocks represents a significant advancement in
                geospatial data management and publication. Benefits include
                improved interoperability, standardization, and data reuse,

                Game experts are not necessarily programmers. Game experts are
                able to design games. The problem is that there are mostly
                designing languages which are only simulating games. Languages
                for developing games are not just requiring programming skills
                but they do not support design processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution is Idea Flowing Language. IFL is a graphical domain
                specific language which allows designing and developing games at
                the same time. In other terms said when the expert designs a
                game by a model of IFL it is not needed to design a controller
                or a view for it at once; even without having this it is already
                possible to just test and play the game at the model. Because of
                this capsulation possibility for the game logic and the game
                layout MVC can be fulfilled in the context of domain specific
                languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Basically, this all can be fulfilled since IFL is a mash between
                petri nets in a high level, behavior trees and Harel state
                machines. Idea flowing language is currently designed for little
                games like dice games. In the future apps with a lot of
                interaction should be possible. By a lot of data processing and
                instances vector engines could be applied.

                As software grows increasingly complex, the number and diversity
                of concerns to be addressed also rises. To answer this diversity
                of concerns, developers may end up using multiple, possibly
                domain-specific, languages in a single software project, a
                practice known as polyglot programming. This practice has gained
                momentum with the rise of execution platforms capable of
                supporting polyglot systems (e.g., GraalVM, possibly with
                Truffle for DSLs). However, despite this momentum, there is a
                notable lack of design-time support for developers working on

                This talk addresses this gap by introducing a novel debugger

                dynamically extensible to accommodate the evolving combination
                of languages used in polyglot software development. It utilizes
                the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) to integrate and coordinate
                existing debuggers within a debugging session. The effectiveness
                of this approach is demoed with a prototype, PolyDebug, and its

                Usually, the integration of two or more enterprise applications
                involves business or technical constraints, which can be
                represented by smart contracts. Nevertheless, writing smart
                contracts is an error-prone task due to the knowledge required
                and the variety of programming languages and blockchains
                available. Jabuti DSL, a domain-specific language (DSL) for
                Enterprise Application Integration, tries to solve this problem
                through simplified syntax and business semantics constructors.
              </p>
              <p>
                As Jabuti DSL smart contracts are non-executable, we have
                developed Jabuti CE. Jabuti CE is a tool for specifying and
                transforming Jabuti DSL smart contracts into executable code. It
                consists of three main components: ANTLR-based Jabuti DSL
                Grammar, VSCode Plugin, and Transformation Engine. The grammar
                contains Jabuti DSL semantic rules. VSCode plugin is an
                extension for VSCode editor and provides some features like code
                highlighting, autocompletion, code navigation, syntax and
                semantic validation, among others. The transformation engine

                Feature models are essential for modelling variabilities in
                software product lines, which often reside in private or
                dispersed repositories. The Universal Variability Language (UVL)
                addresses this issue by standardising the serialisation of
                feature models and promoting community-driven sharing.

                Open science aims to make scientific research and data
                accessible to all. Its principles are based on transparency,
                accessibility and collaboration. This approach can be applied to
                the software product line community using a specific set of
                tools:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>uvlhub to share datasets of feature models,</li>
                <li>
                  flamapy to enrich and extract metrics from these models, and
                </li>
                <li>
                  FM Fact Label to visualise features from feature model data.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                We identify the missing characteristics that feature modelling
                practitioners need in current open science tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through hands-on sessions, participants will gain practical
                experience in using uvlhub to host datasets, flamapy to analyse
                them, and FM Fact Label to visualise them. This will not only
                demonstrate the integration of these tools into their research
                workflows but also show how their work can align with open
                science principles.

                The Enterprise computing is moving steadily to containers and
                using orchestration tools with different flavors of the same
                ground: Kubernetes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kubernetes is capable of managing many machines (physical or
                virtual) to deploy containers in a distributed manner in a way
                we can provide high-availability, flexible load balancing, and
                fast provisioning. Mid and large-sized enterprises run hundreds
                of containers inside such Kubernetes clusters. Therefore the
                need for Observability and Security checking the graph of nodes,
                applications, services, instances & dependencies is a real need
                at scale.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional tools in the Kubernetes landscape are governed by
                textual tools: YAML. There is space for building better
                graphical tools to represent and visualize the current state of
                a cluster (linked with real-time telemetry) showing
                dependencies, failing components, security risk, etc. The model
                discovery process makes a reverse engineering task to discover
                services, pods, containers, networks and its topology. At the
                model level a visualization is provided (Digital Twin) as a
                virtual representation of the physical assets to be observed
                &amp; monitored.

            <div class="abstract">
              <p>
                Spreadsheets are the most widely used programming system,
                notably used by non-technical users who are not familiar with
                general purpose languages (GPLs). From the point of view of the
                “programming experience”, the main characteristic of a
                spreadsheet is that the user writes formulas (i.e., business
                logic) which directly manipulates values, in contrast to the use
                of abstract expressions in GPLs. In this respect, some low-code
                platforms (e.g., AppSheets) have attempted to use the idea of
                spreadsheets to facilitate its adoption by end-users, but they
                do not fully exploit the flexibility of spreadsheets. In this
                context, we are developing a type of low code platform designed
                around the spreadsheet metaphor, based on direct manipulation of
                concrete values, plus an application building environment based
                on live programming techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of this platform is to enable end-users construct
                simple applications, tailored to their needs by simply using
                well-known concepts from spreadsheets. In this talk we will
                present the goals of the project, named LowSheets, some
                motivating examples, the architecture of the platform and
                showcase the platform though a demo.

                Today's digital hardware systems are a blend of heterogeneous
                subsystems, including general-purpose processors, customized
                processors, complex state-machines and dedicated hardware
                accelerators. This complexity challenges the description,
                synthesis, and programming of these architectures, highlighting
                the need for increased levels of abstraction. The current trend
                involves integrating higher-level software concepts into
                hardware design, which can be uncomfortable for hardware
                engineers.

              <p>
                This proposal suggests a language that aims to elevate the
                abstraction level in digital system representation while
                preserving critical aspects of hardware engineering, such as
                synchronization, communication, customized programming, and
                optimization for power, area, and speed. It introduces a
                hardware description language based on domain-specific language
                methodology (ANTLR), demonstrating how hardware and software
                domains can coexist by creating appropriate syntactical
                structures aligned with the underlying hardware model.

              <p>
                Introducing the Arazzo Specification which enables the ability
                to define and document workflows, a series of API calls, that
                when woven together accomplish a specific business objective.
                The new specification was developed under the OpenAPI
                Initiative, and complements current specifications, including
                OpenAPI and AsyncAPI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arazzo provides a deterministic recipe for using APIs and
                enables code generation tooling for a given API based on
                use-cases. Additionally, Arazzo improves regulatory checks and
                bridges gaps where use-case flows span multiple API
                descriptions. The new specification provides a sufficient level
                of predictable determinism to AI models, allowing them to offer
                a natural language abstraction on top of the business use cases,
                while in parallel giving interoperability benefits to the actual
                API providers. The result is more value, with less vendor
                lock-in, and consistent API offerings for both humans and the
                new wave of AI consumers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, there's enormous potential to enhance the developer
                experience (DX) and API documentation by enabling graphical
                rendering of API workflows. The specification also improves
                human understanding of how to consume API endpoints to achieve a
                specific goal. Arazzo descriptions can stay up-to-date and be
                assertable against the underlying APIs. This reduces the need
                for out-of-band documentation sharing, reduces the time and
                effort required to implement complex workflows, and automates
                testing and other repetitive tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the Arazzo Specification improves the capability of API
                specifications to tell the story of the API in a manner that
                improves interoperability across industries.

                Concurrent Collaboration is a feature gaining momentum for SaaS
                tools. Tools like Google Suite, Office 365 or Figma have
                popularized it in the last few years. Remote work has been a key
                driver for the adoption of Concurrent Collaboration. On the
                other hand, CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) are a
                powerful abstraction able to allow concurrent and offline

              <p>
                Many DSLs end up having expressions, ranging from relatively
                simple logic and/or arithmetic, to more intricate, query-like
                collection and object traversals. More often than not, such a
                “funclarative” expression sublanguage is built from scratch —
                which is fun but also costly.
              </p>
              <p>
                GenFPL is a new tool to generate a ready-to-run Functional
                Programming-style Language (FPL) to easily embed in existing
                DSLs — provided they can be defined using LionWeb. It's inspired
                by KernelF for JetBrains MPS, while aiming to be portable and as
                technology-independent as possible. It does so by generating a
                coherent family of extensible languages from a simple
                configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this talk, Meinte will demonstrate how GenFPL is used to
                implement a FPL and integrate it in an existing DSL. He will
                also touch on implementing and running an interpreter in
                TypeScript, defining a concrete syntax using Freon, integrating
                on the type (system)-level, and introducing a standard library.
                Finally, the author will discuss some design trade-offs around
                (not) providing functional abstractions.

              <p>
                At last year's LangDev we introduced
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuR2C7DZ_r0">LionWeb</a
                >: Language Interfaces on the Web. Since then LionWeb has
                developed quite a lot. We expect to release a new version 2024.1
                including a number of new features. The existing parts of the
                specification have been sharpened, but most importantly this
                LionWeb release includes the first part of the server protocol.
                This part is the "bulk" protocol, as it focuses on retrieving
                and storing (sub)trees of nodes. This protocol is not defined
                simply as dumb storage for model trees, but also defines
                validation requirements to ensure that the model tree always
                remains correct in relation to the LionWeb specification. As
                always, we don't just write specifications, but also implement
                them in parallel. To validate the bulk specification we
                therefore developed a lionweb-repository, acting as a reference
                implementation of the bulk protocol. Also new are several
                implementations in more programming languages and test suites to
                ensure that different implementations conform to the
                specification.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this moment we are working on the next aspect of the server:
                the "delta" protocol. This will enable software components to
                subscribe to model changes in the server and allow sending and
                receiving changes to nodes. We will end with naming several
                development projects using LionWeb in real life.

            <div class="abstract">
              <p>
                The LionWeb initiative was started two years ago, to facilitate
                the interoperability between various language engineering tools
                and to allow for the reuse of language engineering and modeling
                tools. In this talk, we'll demonstrate our implementation of the
                LionWeb protocol in Rascal. Rascal is a meta-programming
                language that is used for the implementation of textual DSLs and
                for more generic use cases of syntax-based analysis and
                transformation of programming code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Comparing to the tools already integrated with LionWeb, Rascal
                belongs to the traditional grammarware space. In Rascal a DSL is
                defined in the form of a concrete syntax grammar. Native to
                LionWeb models are represented as abstract syntax trees and new
                types are defined using algebraic data types. Furthermore,
                Rascal doesn't support traditional OO concepts: there are no
                objects, only immutable values; no user defined sub-typing
                (inheritance); all models are pure trees, without explicit
                cross-referencing between their nodes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will demonstrate how we close this expressiveness gap and
                implement LionWeb constructs in Rascal, allowing for importing
                LionWeb languages (M2) and models (M1) in Rascal. This work is
                inspired by and partially reproduces the work from 2017 by Tijs
                van der Storm on the conversion between Ecore and Rascal.

                The current implementation of

                the exchange of models between different technologies and
                programming languages. In this talk, we will present a case
                study of converting LionWeb representable models into Truffle
                intermediate representation (AST) and eventually executing the

                Truffle is a language implementation framework that enables
                custom language implementations in Java. When compiled by
                <a href=" https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>, languages
                implemented in Truffle are translated into efficient machine
                code. Enabled by this technology stack, specific instances of a
                class can be optimized in order to generate efficient machine
                code, using a technique called partial evaluation. Moreover,
                GraalVM provides a framework for creating language-agnostic
                tools like debuggers and profilers.

                In the context of this work, we are able to execute the models
                outside a language workbench (e.g. MPS) in order to benefit from
                the high-performance execution framework and language-agnostic
                tools.

                In software language engineering, interpreters enable the direct
                execution of program code or models, providing instant feedback
                at system runtime. As reuse is key in developing sophisticated
                modeling languages, their generated and hand-written artifacts
                must be seamlessly integrated. This challenge also applies when
                combining partial interpreters of different language components
                into a composed infrastructure.

                While there are solutions tailored for specific technical

                incorporating partial interpreters into the context of larger
                languages. In this talk, we present the architectural design for
                integrating model interpreters of compositional languages. The
                concept is based on an extended visitor pattern for
                compositional data structures and is demonstrated in the context

                Low-code platforms have gained popularity for accelerating
                complex software engineering tasks through visual interfaces and
                pre-built components. Software language engineering,
                specifically language composition, is a complex task that
                requires expertise in the technological spaces of language
                engineering, their integration in workbenches, and in the
                composition mechanisms. To reduce this complexity, we introduce
                a low-code platform based on a method for (almost) black-box
                language composition of external DSLs using language components
                that encompass textual syntax and translational realization of
                semantics. The platform enables language engineers to derive new
                languages from existing languages by systematically composing
                them through a language family. By selecting features within the
                platform's language family, language engineers can create
                tailored languages that cater to specific application domains.
                Through this research, we aim to contribute to the advancement
                of low-code language development and empower language engineers

                Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) usually come with a
                dedicated integrated environment called a modeling workbench. In
                the context of graphical DSMLs, such environments provide
                modelers with dedicated interactive features that help them
                perform navigation and editing tasks. Many of these features are
                generic and can be used by graphical DSMLs without any
                specialization (e.g. a physical zoom). Others require
                specializations in accordance with the involved DSML. For
                instance, a semantic zoom requires specifying which elements of
                the model must be graphically modified at the different zoom
                levels. However, current language workbenches do not propose
                facilities to help language designers in developing such
                semantic-aware features for their graphical modeling
                environments. So language designers must develop these features
                by hand, which is a complex and time-consuming task.

                interactive features of the targeted modeling workbench in the

              <p>
                In this talk, we want to demonstrate a tool for building and
                managing dependencies for JetBrains MPS projects and invite the
                community to contribute to this project.
              </p>
              <p>
                MPS is great for developing languages and extensions for
                languages written by other MPS developers. Extending a language
                not in the same repository becomes more complicated when the
                other language is under active development. Due to this, we
                observe that projects often are developed in one repository.
                These monolithic-like style MPS plugins make reusing parts of
                the project harder for the community.
              </p>
              <p>The challenges that this tool aims to overcome are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  New developers who want to build our extension language need
                  the language we are extending to be installed in MPS to build
                  successfully. MPS can help when the language is in the MPS
                  plugin marketplace. If the language is not in the marketplace
                  or the build job is a CI/CD pipeline, the developer must
                  ensure that the language is installed in MPS.
                </li>
                <li>Solving transitive dependencies.</li>
                <li>
                  The new EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires a project to
                  supply a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) that lists all the
                  used components by the software.
                </li>
              </ol>

          <h2>Questions</h2>
          <p>
            Generally. talks will be arranged in blocks of 25 minutes and 5
            minutes for Q&amp;A.
          </p>
          <p>
            To allow a more accessible Q&amp;A sessions, we will be using
            <a href="https://www.proxyhands.com">Proxyhands</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            ProxyHands is a mobile app that allows people with disabilities or
            shy people to make questions for the sessions direclty from the
            phone. Also if questions exceed the time provided, they can be
            answered offline by the speakears to be be shared later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to install the app and try it during the event. A unique
            code for each session will be shared at the begining of the talk.
